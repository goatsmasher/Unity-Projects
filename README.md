# Unity-Projects
<hr>
<p>Repository of (mostly)small and large projects as I work my way through learning Unity.</p>
<p>These projects were inspired and assigned from a pilot program created by <a href="https://github.com/WorldWideDev">Devon Newsom</a> to eventually work my way from zero Unity knowledge, to being able to use Unity to create 3D games and VR/AR experiences</p>
